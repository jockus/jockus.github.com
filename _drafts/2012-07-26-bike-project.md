## The premise
I like bikes, always have. Started riding motocross when I was 4 years old, and my dad was always tinkering on my motorcross or something else in the basement compartment of our flat building. The thing is, then I discovered video games - then computers, then programming. And that sort of became my main focus in life. I forgot about bikes, although a longing to do motocross again always persisted in the background since I quit when I was 14. Last year I moved sort of out of town, it was time to become a villager. But half of the reason for doing that was that I would need a means of transportation, I would _need_ to get a bike. So I did, and I'm still riding the CBR125 to work and back.
