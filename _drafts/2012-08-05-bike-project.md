title: Bike project - preface
description: Ok, so, crazy idea - I don't know anything about bike mechanics, but I'm going to build (sort of) a bike. It's something I've always wanted to do...

## The premise
I have always liked bikes. Started riding motocross when I was 4 years old, and my dad was always tinkering on my motorcross or something else in the basement compartment of our flat building. I then discovered video games, computers, then programming, which ended up becoming my main focus in life. I forgot about bikes, although a longing to do motocross again always persisted in the background, and custom motorcycles and cars was always of interest. Que needing transportation, and so I got myself a Honda CBR125, a sports bike style 125cc motorbike with added chav-loud exhaust to boot. However, whilst it gets me to work and back fine, you do miss the power to be able to overtake that granny persisting on driving 10mph less than the current speed limit, regardless whether its 30 or 60. And you do get tired of the smallest gust of wind threatening to throw you across the road because of the small weight of a 125cc bike. And also, sport bikes just aren't my thing. I kind of knew this, but I figured I needed to try one out. So now as I'm getting a bigger bike, rather than going for a bigger brother of the CBR I decided that it's either an offroad style bike or a nice looking custom, and whilst getting back in to motocross would be fun, commuting on one every morning doesn't sound very pleasing. So a custom bike it is.

## Custom motor... race bikes?

The first thing that comes to mind when you think custom motorcycle is probably Harley Davidson and lots of chrome. I've always been attracted to the rougher side of custom though. Things like rat bikes, rusty banged up bikes with matte paint schemes. Custom bikes all stem from post WWII folks needing cheap transportation, and bikes are cheaper than cars, that's what they got. People wanted the bikes to be quick and look good, so they started to modify them. So far so good, however as I'm now living the UK I happened upon something different than the classic Harley Davidsons of the US. In the UK bikes took a slightly different take on the customdeal. They focused their efforts on making the bikes quick first and foremost, because they were used to race between cafes. This lead to an aesthetic much closer to that of race bikes, with forward leaning stances and efficient, lean lines. The Cafe racers.

The classic cafe racer bikes were Norton and Triumph. Those are the ones that were around post WWII in the uk, and what people used to do is build a Triton - take the powerful engine out of a Triumph and put it in a well handling Norton frame, to build on each bikes strength. But cafe racers moved with the times, and as japanese bikes became popular, they were used to build cafe racers too. Most people building cafe racers today tend to go for a 70's Honda CB-series bike. This is what I initially aimed for too as I started to research what bike to base it on. Then that all change when I saw the bike below for sale on ebay. It blew me away.

## Classy, quick... and fearsome!

Suzuki gs750. The first thing that struck me with this bike was the aggressive stance. Most impressive though is that it displays this aggressiveness whilst looking classy and clean, yet still like purpose built racing machine. Classy headlight and gauges, nice clean paint job but an engine that looks like it is designed to race. The thermal shield tape on the exhaust is a really nice touch. This was it, this is what my bike should look like. Time to learn how to build a bike.

Immediatly after seeing this bike I started looking at other, stock Suzuki gs750s. I started to compare pictures of the HS gs750 to figure out what had been changed on the bike. Some things where obvious, like different forks, seat, paint and straight exhaust(!). But the one thing that drew me to the bike in the first place turned out to be less clear, and for a while I didn't get why other cafe racer gs750s just didn't seem to feel right. Eventually it dawned on me, the frame had been altered, and the rear suspension was mounted lower than stock, which gives the bike its stance. No way I'll be able to do that, given that all metal work I've done is randomly mig welding together pieces of scrap metal. Leave that one for later then. 

## Define the problem
So the list I've made up currently looks as follows:

* Get a gs750 or gs550.
* Throw away the stock seat
* Take an angle grinder to the bars sticking out beneath the stock seat
* Mount a cafe racer style seat
* Change front forks
* Get spoked wheels
* Replace headlights and indicators
* Replace gauges
* Tear off anything that's made out of plastic or looks like isn't really needed
* Get a paintjob done
* And of course, thermal tape on the exhaust to finish it off.

There's probably going to be a lot more to do when I get down to the nitty gritty, but for now it seems doable. Next step is to find a suitlable bike, so I'll be scowling eBay the coming winter for the right one.
