title: Carlin Compressor
description: I've got an addiction to fuzz pedals. They're a strange breed - circuit-wise they're similar, but they all seem to sound different. Last weekend I built my first guitar pedal, a copy of a quite different, rare 70s fuzz pedal from Sweden called the Carlin Compressor.

## Fuzzy nuts
Fuzz pedals are strange. Technically they're very simple, just a few transistors connected together to distort an audio signal. However, despite this, or because of it, they all seem to sound and react differently, even between pedals with identical components and wiring. Probably has to do with inaccuracies in the resistors and transistors.
The ones I've used are Analogman Sunface, Fender Tonebender, Death-by-audio something something(a friends pedal) and Dunlop Bonamassa Fuzz Face. Out of these the Bonamassa Fuzz Face is definitely my favourite. At low pickup volumes, it only compresses the signal and adds a shimmery gloss. At higher pickup volumes it adds the fuzz very smoothly to end up with a really warm, not quite as fuzzed out tones as the others. It my opinion it's more useful and lets more of the guitars own sound through.
Of course something like the Tonebender is a different animal all together, with its octave-up sounds. Awesome sounds, very fun to play with, but not as universally useful.

## Fuzzy gear
Dungen, embedded above, has a fuzzed out guitarist by the name of Reine Fiske. He's got some lovely fuzzed out tones, and his equipment reveals a big component in making fuzzes sound good. A fuzz depends a lot on what is going in to it, and where's it going afterwards. Since fuzzes are very sensitive to the input going in to them, using high gain pickups means you won't be able to use the full range of sounds a fuzz can produce. Also, just plugging a fuzz pedal straight in to a completely clean amp can sound harsh. Having overdrive after smooths out the fuzziness a bit. Hendrix used to run a bit of overdrive on his Marshall amps before hitting them with fuzz. Reine Fiske uses an Echolette Klemt tape echo machine for similar effect. Even without the echo engaged the echo's input overdrive and EQ are very nice sounding. If you put the input gain almost on full blast, it compresses the signal in a very dramatic fashion, as can be heard in the song above.

## Sweedo
A friend of mine, Alex, who knows a lot more about electronics than I asked me if I wanted to build some pedals. I immediately thought of a pedal I'd seen in a picture of Reine Fiske's live gear. It was a mystery pedal called the Carlin Compressor, a Compressor/Fuzz combination that a lot of prog guitarists were using in Sweden in the 70s. I've tried to find more info about the pedal, but no copies could be found on eBay and I still haven't been able to find any sound or video clips of it in action. What is very easy to find, oddly enough, is the schematics for the pedal! Turns out the guy who made the pedal in the 70s posted up a schematic of the pedal, along with photos of the original circuit.

## Carlin DYI
Making the pedal wasn't especially dramatic and turned out to be a lot easier than expected, given that the only electronics work I've done in the past is small amounts of soldering. The most tedious part was converting the old school 4 band resistor values to 5 band. After soldering everything on I'd only made three mistakes, all easily rectifiable. Two paths had been soldered together at one point, and two other solder points weren't done well enough.
Here's some pictures of the process.

## Finishing up
I'd recommend it to anyone who's into guitars and effects to try and build one yourself. It's easy and fun! Below I've recorded a demo.
