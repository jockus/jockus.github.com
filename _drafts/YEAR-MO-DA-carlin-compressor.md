title: Carlin Compressor
description: I've got an addiction to fuzz pedals. They're a strange breed - circuit-wise they're similar, but they all seem to sound different. Last weekend I built my first guitar pedal, a copy of a quite different, rare 70s fuzz pedal from Sweden called the Carlin Compressor.

## Fuzzy nuts
Fuzz pedals are strange. They're very simple, just a few transistors connected together to distort an audio signal. However despite this, or because of it, they all seem to sound different, even amongst pedals with identical wiring.
The ones I've used are Analogman Sunface, Fender Tonebender, Death-by-audio something something(a friends pedal) and Dunlop Bonamassa Fuzz Face. Out of these the Bonamassa Fuzz Face is definitly my favourite, it is clearer than the other at low pickup volumes. It only compresses the signal and adds a shimmery gliss. At higher pickup volumes it adds the fuzz very smoothly to end up with a not quite as fuzzed out tones as the other. It my opinion it's more useful and lets more of the guitars own sound through.
Now, of course something like the Tonebender is a different animal all together, with its octave-up sounds. Awesome sounds, very fun to play with, but not as universally useful.
