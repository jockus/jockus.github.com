title: Cafe racer - Preface
description: Ok, so, crazy idea - I don't know anything about bike mechanics, but I'm going to build a bike. Luckily, I think I've made a good choice...

## The premise
I like bikes, always have. Started riding motocross when I was 4 years old, and my dad was always tinkering on my motorcross or something else in the basement compartment of our flat building. I then discovered video games, computers, then programming, which ended up becoming my main focus in life. I forgot about bikes, although a longing to do motocross again always persisted in the background, and custom motorcycles and cars was always of interest. A few months back I moved out of any easy reach of a bus in to work, so I need a means of transportation, so I ended up going for a bike, and I'm still riding the CBR125 to work and back. However, whilst it gets me to work and back fine, you do miss the power to be able to overtake that granny persisting on driving 10mph less than the current speed limit, regardless whether its 30 or 60. And you do get tired of the smallest gust of wind threatening to throw you across the road because of the small weight of a 125cc bike. Alas, sport bikes just aren't my thing, so rather than going for a bigger brother of the CBR I decided that either it's a motocross a custom, and I wouldn't want to commute on a motorcross. So a custom bike it is.

## Custom motor... race bikes?
The first thing that comes to mind when you say custom motorcycle is probably Harley Davidson and loads of chrome. Orange County Choppers. Post WWII people needed cheap transportation and bikes area cheaper than cars. People wanted the bikes to be quick and look good, so they started to modify them. This happened in the UK as well as in the USA of bobbers, but the UK kids took a slightly different take on the deal. They focused their efforts on making the quick first and foremost, because they were used to race between cafes. This lead to an aesthetic much closer to that of race bikes.

## Cafe racers
When you say cafe racer, it seems Norton and Triumph come to mind. Those are the ones that were around post WWII in the uk, and what people used to do is build a Triton - take the powerful engine out of a Triumph and put it in a well handling Norton frame, to build on each bikes strength. But cafe racers moved with the times, and as japanese bikes became popular, they were used to build cafe racers too. Most people building cafe racers today tend to go for a 70's Honda CB-series bike. This is what I initially aimed for too as I started to research what bike to base it on. Then that all change when I saw the bike below for sale on ebay. It blew me away.

## Classy, quick... and fearsome!
Suzuki gs750. The first thing that struck me with this bike was the aggressive stance. It looks like a feral panther gearing up to attack and tear you to shreds. And it displays this aggressiveness whilst looking classy and clean, yet still like purpose built racing machine. Classy headlight and gauges, nice clean paint job but an engine that looks like it is designed to race. The thermal shield tape on the exhaust is a really nice touch. This was it, this is what my bike should look like. Time to learn how to build a bike.

## Define the problem
Immediatly after seeing this bike I started looking on Suzuki gs750. I could see the bike above hidden in the stock appearance, but I knew it'd be a long way off. So I started to compare the picture to figure out what had change. Some things where obvious, others less so.

## Not quite right
No matter how many other gs750s bikes I looked at I couldn't find another one with the same aggressive stance. At first I didn't even notice it, I just couldn't find "it" in the other bikes.

How could I take a stock Suzuki

Order rear seat
Cut off frame
New front forks
