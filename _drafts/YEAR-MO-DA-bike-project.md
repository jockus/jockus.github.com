## The premise
I like bikes, always have. Started riding motocross when I was 4 years old, and my dad was always tinkering on my motorcross or something else in the basement compartment of our flat building. The thing is, then I discovered video games - then computers, then programming. And that sort of became my main focus in life. I forgot about bikes, although a longing to do motocross again always persisted in the background since I quit when I was 14. A few months back I moved out of any easy reach of a bus in to work, so I need a means of transportation, so I ended up going for a bike, and I'm still riding the CBR125 to work and back. However, whilst it gets me to work and back fine, you do miss the power to be able to overtake that granny persisting on driving 10mph less than the current speed limit, regardless of its 60 or 30. And you do get tired of the smallest gust of wind threatening to throw you across the road. So a bigger bike it is.
