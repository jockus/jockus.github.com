## Suzuki details

Changing battery comparment doors to triangle metal sheets. Could use hinges + locking mechanism and use a bit of the empty space beneath for a disk lock/helmet bag storage space.


## Guitars
Ibby
Telecaster knobs - Â£8
GFS Nashville trons - $70

Marshall supa fuzz build


## Vintorez
VSS Vintorez build
Wood handle/body
Actual scope

Nerf long strike as base?

MDF for body, nice wood for shoulder, bondo + sanding for smooth finish
researched recoil mechanism, not feasible. power and strength of linear actuators not good enough

## Reine Fiske sound video
Show off echolette, fuzz, compressor, wah
Big part of recorded sound is LOUD settings
Didn't mean to be a Reine copy, got guitar before and echo was the cheapest
