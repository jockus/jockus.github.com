Actual scope

Nerf long strike as base?

MDF for body, nice wood for shoulder, bondo + sanding for smooth finish
researched recoil mechanism, not feasible. power and strength of linear actuators not good enough

Show off echolette, fuzz, compressor, wah
Big part of recorded sound is LOUD settings
Didn't mean to be a Reine copy, got guitar before and echo was the cheapest
